            <h3>From our director, David Spearman</h3>
			<h4>About Me:</h4>
			<p>The  drama department at J L Mann is under the direction of Mr. David Spearman.  Mr. Spearman is entering his 31st year in theatre education, having taught at Dorman High in Spartanburg, Northwest School for the Arts in Charlotte, J L Mann for 1999 - 2001, and at Starr’s Mill High School in Fayetteville, GA from 2001 - 2015.<br><br>
This year there are three Theatre 1 classes and one Theatre 2, Theatre 3H, 4H class.  The upper level class will present Almost, Maine, November 10, 11, 12, 2016 at 7:30 pm in the auditorium.<br><br>
In March, the drama department will produce the award winning Hairspray!  These auditions are open to the student body.  There will be a mandatory meeting for those who want to audition on November 29 right after school, and the auditions will be on Saturday, December 10.<br><br>
The drama department will also sponsor the Miss J L Mann Scholarship Pageant this year.  The pageant will be open to young ladies in grades 9 - 12 who will compete in casual wear, evening wear, performing talent and personal interview.  Think of Miss America without the swimsuit!  Scholarship will be awarded to the winner and, hopefully, the runners up as well.  There will be an informational meeting in October.  Stay tuned for more details!<br><br>
NONE of the productions are possible without the help of our Patriot Player Patrons!  We DESPERATELY need your help.  Please see the “how to become a Patriot Player Patron” link under the “About Us” section.  We would appreciate ANY help you can give.<br><br>
If you’d like to volunteer to help with set construction, scene painting, costumes, or in any other capacity, please send Mr. Spearman an email with your information.<br><br>
			</p>
			<h4>About the Future:</h4>
			<p>
There are exciting things ahead for the theatre program at J L Mann!  We already have two productions on the calendar; one full length romantic comedy and a musical in the spring!  There will also be some new and exciting things added to the production calendar!<br><br>
You can play a leading role in helping us build the program! Please consider becoming a Patron of J L Mann High School Theater.  Depending upon your donation,  patrons may receive season tickets, recognition in our playbills,  and a tax deduction. Your generous donation will be used for enrichment, set design and construction, props, music, scripts, lighting and sound needs, costumes, posters, programs, and a variety of other items needed for productions.<br><br>
As the director, I will take pride in offering an incredible performing arts experience to every student in our program. In fact, I won't turn any student away.  Should a student want to be involved in the productions in some capacity, I will find a space to utilize the talent of that student!<br><br>
As you may know, the School District of Greenville County provides only basic support of theatre programs. While we are fortunate that Greenville County holds the arts in high regard as an academic subject, the reality is that we receive no funding from the school, or the county.  Our shows are run completely off donations. The financial investment to maintain the level of excellence in J L Mann High School’s theatre program is great.<br><br>
We CANNOT do this without you!  PLEASE consider giving to these deserving students.  I am confident you will be proud of the work that we all will produce.<br>You can reach us at:<br>
